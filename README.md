My final senior paper - Support Vector Machines in Basketball Player Development

In this paper, I outline the machine learning algorithm known as the Support Vector Machine and show how it can be applied to help basketball players develop their skills. I completed this paper at St. John's University (MN) as part of the graduation capstone requirement.
